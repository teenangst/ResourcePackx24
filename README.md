# ResourcePackx24

Tool to allow easier editing of 24x24 MineCraft resource packs in 1.17

## How to use

1. Run `ResourcePackx24.exe`
  - If this is the first time running this you will be prompted to enter the location of the working directory, the output directory, desired output size, and if these settings should be used without prompt in the future (this can be changed inside the `config.json` file, or just delete the file)
2. Upon startup files will be duplicated over and resized if they are 24x24
  - On future startups only file changes will be made
3. After initialisation has finished any changes in the working directory will be reflexted in the output directory.
